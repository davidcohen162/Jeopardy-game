# Jeopardy-game
A game that presents jeopardy questions to players. Whether the game will be use a GUI or will be text based is still undecided. 
The project will use the api from jservice.io. jservice.io is a database with over 158,000 Jeopardy questions with an online api. You can request random questions, questions in a specific category, and you can request a list of categories. jservice.io returns JSON data.
The project will use Google's Gson library to parse JSON data and convert it to Java objects's.
